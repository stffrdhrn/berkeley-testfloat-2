History of Major Changes to Berkeley TestFloat, up to Release 2c

Releases of Berkeley TestFloat normally parallel those of Berkeley
SoftFloat, on which TestFloat is based.  Each TestFloat release necessarily
incorporates all bug fixes from the corresponding release of SoftFloat.

Release 2c (2015 January)

-- Fixed mistakes affecting some 64-bit processors.

-- Made minor updates to the documentation, including improved wording for
   the legal restrictions on using TestFloat.


There was never a Release 2b.

Release 2a (1998 December)

-- Added support for testing conversions between floating-point and 64-bit
   signed integers.

-- Improved the Makefiles.

Release 2 (1997 June)

-- Integrated the generation of test cases and the checking of system
   results into a single program.  (Before they were separate programs,
   normally joined by explicit command-line pipes.)

-- Improved the sequence of test cases.

-- Added support for testing 80-bit double-extended-precision and 128-bit
   quadruple precision.

-- Made program output more readable, and added new command arguments.

-- Reduced dependence on the quality of the standard `rand' function for
   generating test cases.  (Previously naively expected `rand' to be able
   to generate good random bits for the entire machine word width.)

-- Created `testsoftfloat', with its own simpler complete software floating-
   point ("slowfloat") for comparison purposes.

-- Made some changes to the source file structure, including renaming
   `environment.h' to `milieu.h' (to avoid confusion with environment
   variables).

Release 1a (1996 July)

-- Added the `-tininessbefore' and `-tininessafter' options to control
   whether tininess should be detected before or after rounding.
