with the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point, by John R. Hauser.

THIS SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED AS IS, FOR FREE.  Although reasonable effort has
been made to avoid it, THIS SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN FAULTS THAT WILL AT TIMES

DERIVATIVE WORK THEY CREATE USING ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE.

Derivative works require also that (1) the source code for the derivative work
includes prominent notice that the work is derivative, and (2) the source code
includes prominent notice of these three paragraphs for those parts of this
code that are retained.

This has been modified to work as needed by Stafford Horne.
